Conflict -> Element of struggle eg between players, chance or teams
Control - > These are rules they are either simple, complex. Fixed or flexible
Closure -> when games come to an end
Contravance -> elements of artificality  {eg infusion of powers

Microgame - >brief game last btw 30 secs and 10 mins
What are the qualities of a microgame?

#Attributes of a game
------------------------
1. Goal -> this gives the player the purpose
They should be challanging yet achievable.
2. Feedback -> when a game updates a player on how they are doing
examples include:, attemps left, cumulative points, health bar
3. Voluntary participation
4. Rules
Game genres
1. Action games
2, Simulatoin games - > depicts real events
types of simulations include sports simulation,  flight simulation, boat 
Puzzle games
Augmented reality games -> These games mimic real life situations 
and could be played for fun or improvement of human lives
#components of a game
Opening screen 
menu screen
music
sound effects
time -> timing a task,
lives 
obstacle
levels
adversaries -> who you're playing against

#Unity Documentation
#------------------------
Hierarchy window - > a hierarchical text representation of all the game objects.
Scene view -> For representation of a 2D or 3D perspective of the game
Game view -> Simulates your final rendered game through scene cameras. Hitting run will begin simulation of the game.
Cameras ->components that create an image of a viewpoint. The output is either drawn on screen or captured as texture
Overlays - > contain basic tools for manipulation of the scene
Inspector window - > for viewing and editing the properties of game objects.
Game object -> fundamental objects in unity that represent characters, scenes and props. 
They act as containers for components which implement the functionality of these objects.
Project window - > displays library of assets present (imported) into the projects.
Status bar -> provides notifications of unity processes.
#RigidBody
A component that allow game objects to act under the control of physics
ie uses NVIDIA PhysX physics engine - > an engine that allows reaction to collisions and gravity

#Properties of RigidBody
Mass -> in kg
Drag  -> Air resistance affecting the object (0- no resistance , 
infinity -> object cant move 
Angular Drag -> 
Use Gravity
Is Kinematic
Interpolate
Collision Detection

Colliders ->  They attach on gameObjects to define their shapes which are then used for
physical collisions.
-> They don't have to be exactly the same as the mesh of the object.
-> They are invisible


#Categories seperates into 2D and 3D
#2D
-Box collider 2D
-Circle Collider 3D
#3D
-Box Collider
-Sphere Collider
-Capsule Collider
Collision - > How does it occur?
when the physics engines detects that the colliders of 2 gameObjects have overlaped or
made contact when atleast one has a rigid body component and is in motion.

#Body types for 2D RigidBody
#Static
#-----
-No real rigidbody component attached to them, so the physics engine considers it to be
not moving
-applied to static gameObjects such as trees, walls, ground etc
-OnTrigger and OnCollision don't work
#Kinematic
-> Are entirely  driven by scripts
-> only process collisions with dynamic game objects
-> Dynamic Game Objects -> gameObjects that can move during runtime

#Dynamic Game Characters
these gameObjects are driven by a physics engine which controls the motion
(force, velocity, gravity etc..)

#Categories of Behaviour
Focal point
anticipation
annoiced change
Believable events and behavious
Ovalapping events and behaviour
#Principals of Environment
1.Focal point = gives player idea of what to focus on.
2.Anticipation = creation of suspence whithing. Informs the player that something is about to happen.
3.Believable Events and Behaviour
4.Overlapping events and behaviour - other activites outside the primary activity which can influence the events
#spacing can affect pacing
-How much time is spaced betweeen interaction of game objects?
Vary complexity - pacing
Pacing and spacing both form progression
Pacing - descibes the relationship betweeen an activity its intensity and duration in a game.
Spacing - range between objects and their interactivity.
